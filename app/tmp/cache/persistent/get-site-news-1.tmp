It is a limited release, which means while it is availble to the public, we are largely not promoting it. This is because we recommend users that download this, to at least have minor PHP knowledge - but it is a fairly stable version.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIncluded are instructions on how to install this version. In the admin panel, after installation, users will also find a bug report tool due to this release being a beta. Outside of that, have fun. We just ask to report any issues (or suggestions) and that if you start to use this release for a public site - starting with this version, future versions will be upgradeable so while we reccommend waiting until the 3.0 Final release, webmasters can start early now.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca style=\u0022color: black; border: 0px; text-decoration: initial;\u0022 href=\u0022https:\/\/github.com\/insanevisions\/AdaptCMS\/archive\/beta.zip\u0022\u003EClick here to download\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E"}]

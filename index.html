          <h3>Welcome to AdaptCMS on Github</h3>

<p>The current recommended version is 2.0.4, but you can get the newest version (currently <strong>Beta 2</strong>) by following these steps:</p>

<p><code>
git clone git@github.com:insanevisions/AdaptCMS.git
git checkout Beta_2
</code></p>

<p>Be sure to setup writable permissions for the following directories:</p>

<ul>
<li>app/Plugin</li>
<li>app/Old_Plugins</li>
<li>app/webroot</li>
<li>app/View</li>
<li>app/Config/config.php</li>
<li>app/Config/core.php</li>
</ul><h3>Current Status</h3>

<p>The new version is currently regarded as usable, but not recommended for production use. Heavy browser testing, bug testing will begin shortly - but in the meantime it is okay to try out or to get familiar with the system as large changes are unlikely to happen short-term.</p>

<h3>Why AdaptCMS?</h3>

<p>There are a lot of CMS's on the market, so it's pretty tough to compete when others have whole teams - but we think there is still room. Using the cakePHP framework and being completely re-written in every way (PHP, JS, CSS, even mysql tables) - AdaptCMS attempts to use some new technologies and have a set of tools that other developers can use and sites can use. AdaptCMS is targeted to small-medium sized websites and is for users that have either a familiarity with PHP (for templates) or know someone that does.</p>

<p>A very accessible and customizable theme and plugin interface is built for anyone familiar with cakePHP can build both things very quickly and easily. Easy to use permission management, article management and file/media management is usable for a user at any level.</p>

<h3>Author</h3>

<p>AdaptCMS is currently a one-man show, run by <a href="https://github.com/charliepage88" class="user-mention">@charliepage88</a>. Having worked on CMS's now for at least 9 years, this CMS is his baby and hope others will enjoy the new version when it releases.</p>
